The semantic description about the localization area is defined through subclasses of aoi:AreaOfInterest. Thereby, the classification of the areas is performed based on their axial position in three-dimensional space. At the current state of the developed AOI ontology the subclasses, which are used for characterizing an AOI, have been designed towards describing areas in a cubic building component. Since most structural relevant components in a building, such as walls, beams, columns, or slabs, are defined through a cubic geometry, a great amount of the construction can be described via AOI. Consequently, areas in non-cubic objects e.g., some types of support components or shell structures are difficult to represent and localize via AOI. Furthermore, AOI primarily serve for describing an approximate area of a component for semantic localization of topologically linked objects and is not suited for an application in objects that have a complex geometry.</span>
