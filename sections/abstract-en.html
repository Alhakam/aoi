<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <span>The ontology for Areas of Interest (AOI) is an auxiliary ontology that semantically describes areas on a component which contain other subcomponents or objects. This is especially useful for the semantic localization of affecting damages(defined in DOT).<br>
  The concept of AOI aims for extending current web ontologies that are formalized in OWL without significantly changing their proposed modelling concepts. Instead, the AOI ontology provides an additional modelling option, which enhances the extended ontologies with a function to locate objects that are topologically connected.</span>

  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The namespace for AOI terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://w3id.org/AOI#</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The suggested prefix for the AOI namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">aoi</span>

    An AOI, represented through an instance of aoi:AreaOfInterest, is always linked with an individual that represents a physical object, through the Object Property aoi:hasAreaOfInterest. Individuals, which are localized through the AOI, are assigned to it via the Object Property aoi:locates or one corresponding subproperty. The semantic description of the related localization is defined through the AOI itself and additional data properties that could be linked with it.<br>
    An AOI is modelled by describing an area on a selected surface of a building component, as it is usually done in damage inspections or when identifying objects on an existing structure. Additionally, it is often determined whether the area is located on the surface level of the related component or an internal area. The vertical alignment y of the reference system is determined based on the force direction of the gravity Fg since the structural behaviour and function of each building component is heavily dependent on it. The horizontal axis x of the reference system is orthogonal to the vertical axis and on the components surface (contrary to the axis z for defining the components depth). In this regard, the AOI subclasses for defining horizontal areas are designed in such a way that the direction along the horizontal axis is not relevant, since there is only a distinction between horizontal and peripheral areas.

<span>Since multiple horizontal areas of a component could be of relevance, it is often necessary to distinguish between them. Therefore, instances of aoi:ComponentSide can be linked with the component representation via aoi:hasSide. Instances of aoi:ComponentSide function as part of the component and similarly can be linked with an AOI. Through a property chain, it is possible to reason the relation between the AOI and the component. Instances of aoi:ComponentSide could be characterized through additional properties e.g., the cardinal direction or whether the side is in an external area of the building for better identification and localization.</span>
