# AOI - Areas of Interest

The ontology for Areas of Interest (AOI) is an auxiliary ontology that semantically describes areas on a component which contain other subcomponents or objects. This is especially useful for the semantic localization of affecting damages(defined in DOT).

The concept of AOI aims for extending current web ontologies that are formalized in OWL without significantly changing their proposed modelling concepts. Instead, the AOI ontology provides an additional modelling option, which enhances the extended ontologies with a function to locate objects that are topologically connected.
